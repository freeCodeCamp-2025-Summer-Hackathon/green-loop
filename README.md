## 🚀 How to Run the Backend Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/studycircle.git
cd studycircle/backend
```

### 2. Initialize the database (Only once)

```bash
python database.py
```

> This will run SQL commands to create the required tables.
> ⚠️ You only need to do this **once** after cloning or resetting your environment.

### 3. Run the FastAPI development server

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

`main.py` is the **entry point** of the backend application.

🎉 That’s it! Your backend is now running locally.
